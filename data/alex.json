My equipment includes a Wouxun 2m handheld, two Software Defined Radios built from kits (a SoftRock and a Peaberry) and a 20W amplifier also built from a kit. I am planning to build a magnetic loop antenna soon.\n\n**Open Source Projects**\n\nI am planning to make this website software available [on GitHub](https://github.com/talex004/) soon.
